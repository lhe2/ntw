# ntw

code associated with analysing data from spring 2022-fall 2023 ntw experiments.

3 expts were conducted during the time period mentioned above (below). growth/development data were collected for all 3 expts and fertility data was collected for the night temperature expts.

-   `temps`: a 2x2

-   `acc`: looking at damage accumulation

-   `NTs`: varying minimum night temperature

pre-analysis scripts:

-   **ntw_data_cleaning.Rmd:** pulls in and cleans data for main growth/dev/survival analyses for the 3 expts

-   **ntw_helper_functions.R:** some stock user-defined functions and aesthetics objects for convenience

growth/dev analysis scripts:

-   **overall_controls.Rmd:** looking at the internal controls across the 3 expts

-   **EXPT_details-analyses.Rmd:** see above for details

# ntw

code associated with analysing data from spring 2022 ntw experiments

relevant documents:

* prelim-analysis.Rmd: most significant efforts to analyse data. includes
  * data cleaning
  * growth/development analysis + figures
  * survival curves
* code-archive.Rmd: archived chunks of code from prelim-analysis.Rmd
* development.R: 1st version of me trying to code everything
* temp figs.xlsx: old figures in excel

in the figs folder, most up-to-date generated figures. (data is batched) in the archive, analyses are done on unbatched data.

* instar/temp: experiment type
* a/l: adult or larva
* growth/surv: growt or survival

# todos

for analysis2:

- add 6ths, 7ths in to steps 2 and 3
- add kill curves
- check m/f ratios
- write up better auto-mutate columns...: do it in R vs in excel..
- make header names consistent before merging sheets
- indicate source popns (lab, field, f1)
- create columns to determine if pupation attempted, got stuck
- redo ignores
- compare actual 260 vs diurnal (need to figure out ids)
- ignore overly long lived things

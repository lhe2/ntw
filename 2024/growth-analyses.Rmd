# 0. roadmap & loading

## - **questions**

- (pilot) what is the average time spent in each instar after transferring to constant temps?
  - where do bugs "line up" in their dev at 4th and 5th?
- does getting stuck make a difference on survival?
- are the avg growth outcomes different if you keep the survivors vs not?
- how 2024 ctrls compare to 2023 ctrls?

# 2. time to dev stages (july pilot)

## - wrangling

```{r}
# doing this separately from the helpers stuff bc this is more specific to the pilot lol
wide_all.trttime <- wide_all %>%
  mutate(tt.3rd = jdate.3rd - jdate.hatch,
         tt.4th = jdate.4th - jdate.hatch,
         tt.5th = jdate.5th - jdate.hatch,
         tt.wander = jdate.wander - jdate.hatch, 
         tt.died = jdate.pmd - jdate.hatch,
         tt.intrt = case_when(is.na(jdate.pmd) ~ jdate.pupa - jdate.3rd,
                              TRUE ~ jdate.pmd - jdate.3rd),
         is.pmd = case_when(is.na(jdate.pmd) ~ 0,
                            TRUE ~ 1) # pmd stuff gets dropped in the pivot regardless
         )

# stats of major dev pts

               values_drop_na = TRUE,
               names_pattern = ("([a-z]*)\\.(\\d*[a-z]*)"))
```


## - stats

```{r}
# includes pmd
long_major %>%
  group_by(trt, instar)
  

```

```{r}
# excludes pmd

  filter(is.pmd == 0 &

  mutate(tth = tt*24) %>%
  summarise(avg.mass = mean(na.omit(mass)),
            se.mass = sd(na.omit(mass))/sqrt(length(na.omit(mass))),
            avg.tt = mean(na.omit(tt)),
            se.tt = sd(na.omit(tt))/sqrt(length(na.omit(tt))),
            avg.tth = mean(na.omit(tth)),
            se.tth = sd(na.omit(tth))/sqrt(length(na.omit(tth))),
            logmass = log(mass), 
            avg.logmass = mean(na.omit(logmass)),
            se.logmass = sd(na.omit(logmass))/sqrt(length(na.omit(logmass))),
            n=n())

```

## - plot

```{r}
lmaj_stats %>%
  mutate(trt = case_when(trt == 267 ~ "26±7°C",

                         trt == 380 ~ "38±0°C"),
         trt = factor(trt, levels = (c("26±7°C", "26±0°C", "33±0°C", "38±0°C")))
         ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = trt, x = avg.tth, shape = instar, color = trt)) +

       y = "treatment", x = "hrs since hatching")

# do timing from 3rd

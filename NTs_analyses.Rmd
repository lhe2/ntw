TODO 240108: at some point i need to reorganise this probably (idk how much of these are descriptive but not today!)

# 0.1 questions/responses of interest

- within the NTs, how many go sup? what's the breakdown (if any)? do certain trts lead to more sup?
- what does overall larval growth look like? (i.e. mass gained per day?)
- pupal response: final pupal mass? time to pup? survival to pup? survival dynamics?
  - break it down by min T (maybe mean/flucT later...)
  - can we use the 2x2 results to inform?
- diet/sex effects?


# A. looking for sups

**questions:** how many go sup? how many die early? how many are slow?

## - look at summary stats and pcts

```{r summ stats}
# NT stats
wide_all %>%
  filter.NTs2() %>% filter(pop == "field") %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(field_n=n(),
            pct.pmd = round(sum(final.fate == "pmd")/field_n*100, digits = 1),
            #pct.slow = round(sum(ignore.reason == "slow")/n*100, digits = 1),
            pct.sup = round(sum(if.sup == "Y")/field_n*100, digits = 1),
            pct.6th = round(sum(sup == 6)/sum(if.sup == "Y")*100, digits = 1),
            pct.7th = round(sum(sup == 7)/sum(if.sup == "Y")*100, digits = 1))
            #n.pmd = sum(final.fate == "pmd"),

wide_all %>%
  filter.NTs2() %>% filter(pop == "lab") %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(lab_n=n(),
            pct.pmd = round(sum(final.fate == "pmd")/lab_n*100, digits = 1),
            #pct.slow = round(sum(ignore.reason == "slow")/n*100, digits = 1),
            pct.sup = round(sum(if.sup == "Y")/lab_n*100, digits = 1),
            pct.6th = round(sum(sup == 6)/sum(if.sup == "Y")*100, digits = 1),
            pct.7th = round(sum(sup == 7)/sum(if.sup == "Y")*100, digits = 1))

```

### - visualise with barplots

```{r sup barplots}
# make these into barplots instead

wide_all %>%
  filter.NTs2() %>% 
  #filter(!(pop == "lab" & diet == "TB")) %>%
  filter(pop != "F1") %>%
  mutate(sup = factor(sup)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = trt.stage, fill = sup)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(title = "NTs: supernumerary fates", fill = "supernumerary stage", x = "treatment", y = "percent") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = NT_labels, guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) +
  facet_wrap(~pop) +
  theme_bw() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Greens") 
  #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

# did i filter out the diet stuff...
  
```

# B1. growth per day; end points

compare overall development of all individuals compared to average growth (avg growth over time)

## - (**) prep the dfs for plotting

(**) calculate summary growth stats df 
  - there's a lot of downstream code that relies on this codeblock LOL hence the (**)
```{r calc dev_L stats df} 
# pull out the lab bugs
long_lf <- long_all %>% filter(pop == "lab" | pop == "field") 

# individual dev stats
dev_L <- long_lf %>%
  filter(!(final.fate == "pmd" | final.fate == "misc")) %>%
  filter.ins.topup() %>%
  mutate(logmass = log(mass))

# do the summary stats
devsumm_L <- dev_L %>%
  group_by(pop, trt.stage, instar) %>%
  summarise(avg.mass = mean(na.omit(mass)),
            se.mass = sd(na.omit(mass))/sqrt(length(na.omit(mass))),
            avg.tt = mean(na.omit(tt)),
            se.tt = sd(na.omit(tt))/sqrt(length(na.omit(tt))),
            avg.logmass = mean(na.omit(logmass)),
            se.logmass = sd(na.omit(logmass))/sqrt(length(na.omit(logmass))),
            n=n())

# for pulling out supernumeraries.. need to tweak
# devsumm_Lsups <- dev_L %>%
#   group_by(pop, sup, trt.stage, instar) %>%
#   summarise(avg.mass = mean(na.omit(mass)),
#             se.mass = sd(na.omit(mass))/sqrt(length(na.omit(mass))),
#             avg.tt = mean(na.omit(tt)),
#             se.tt = sd(na.omit(tt))/sqrt(length(na.omit(tt))),
#             avg.logmass = mean(na.omit(logmass)),
#             se.logmass = sd(na.omit(logmass))/sqrt(length(na.omit(logmass))),
#             n=n())

# see 'plot NTs' under 'overall growth'
  
```

filter the relevant bugs out for plotting
```{r filter out NT bugs from dev_L}
NT_dev <- dev_L %>% filter.NTs2()
#NT_devsumm <- devsumm_L %>% filter.NTs()
NT_devsumm <- dev_L %>% filter.NTs2() %>% calc.devsumm.trtstg()
```

make another df with summary stats for the sup bugs for plotting:

```{r another df with sups pulled out}
#NTsups_devsumm <- devsumm_Lsups %>% filter.NTs2()
NTsups_devsumm <- NT_dev %>%
  group_by(pop, sup, trt.stage, instar) %>%
  calc.devsumm() %>%
  mutate(if.sup = case_when(sup == 0 ~ "N", TRUE ~ "Y"))
```

<!-- ### - line plots -->

<!-- ### - all bugs larval instars -->
plot avg growth of all bugs (sups included in math)
```{r avg larval growth all bugs}
NT_devsumm %>%
  #filter(!(instar == "3rd" | instar == "pupa")) %>%
  filter(instar != "pupa") %>%
  #filter(sup == 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg.tt, y=avg.logmass, color=trt.stage)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(shape = instar), size = 3) +
  geom_point(data=(NT_dev %>% filter(instar != "pupa")), aes(x=tt, y=logmass, color=trt.stage), alpha = 0.25) + 
  NT_aes() + facet_wrap(~pop) +
  labs(title = "NTs: average development from 3rd - wander", color = "treatment", y = "log(mass (mg))", x = "days to instar",
       caption = "L+F, no pmd, enter at hatch")
```

==> this is hard to separate out the sups and imo shouldnt do the math w the sups + non-sups combined, so:


<!-- ### - sup bugs separated -->
plot avg growth bugs but separate out the sups

(so 3 groups total: bugs with 1-5 instars, bugs that had 6th, bugs that had 7th)
```{r avg larval growth separate sups}
# plot only from 4th instar onward bc 3rd looks the same, basically
NTsups_devsumm %>%
  filter(!(instar == "3rd" | instar == "pupa")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg.tt, y=avg.logmass, color=trt.stage)) +
  geom_line(aes(lty = as.factor(sup))) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = instar), size = 3) +
  geom_point(data=NT_dev, aes(x=tt, y=logmass, color=trt.stage), alpha = 0.25) + 
  NT_aes() + facet_wrap(if.sup~pop) +
  labs(title = "NTs: average development from 4th - wander", color = "treatment", y = "log(mass (mg))", x = "days to instar",
       caption = "L+F, no pmd, enter at hatch")
```


still messy. try again but add sup as a Y/N
```{r var}
# trying this again adding "if.sup" as Y/N
  # a little better but still hard to compare
NTsups_devsumm %>%
  filter(!(instar == "3rd" | instar == "pupa")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg.tt, y=avg.logmass, color=trt.stage)) +
  geom_line(aes(lty = as.factor(sup))) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = instar), size = 3) +
  geom_point(data=NT_dev, aes(x=tt, y=logmass, color=trt.stage), alpha = 0.25) + 
  NT_aes() + facet_wrap(~pop) +
  labs(title = "NTs: average development from 4th - wander", color = "treatment", y = "log(mass (mg))", x = "days to instar",
       caption = "L+F, no pmd, enter at hatch")
```

try again, focusing on the trt.stages that produce sups instead
```{r var}
NTsups_devsumm %>%
  filter(!(instar == "3rd" | instar == "pupa")) %>%
  #filter(if.sup == "Y") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg.tt, y=avg.logmass, color=trt.stage)) +
  geom_line(aes(lty = as.factor(sup))) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = instar), size = 3) +
  geom_point(data=NT_dev, aes(x=tt, y=logmass, color=trt.stage), alpha = 0.25) + 
  NT_aes() + facet_wrap(if.sup~pop) +
  labs(title = "NTs: average development from 4th - wander", color = "treatment", y = "log(mass (mg))", x = "days to instar",
       caption = "L+F, no pmd, enter at hatch") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.001, 1))
```

try faceting differently:
```{r var}
NTsups_devsumm %>%
  filter(!(instar == "3rd" | instar == "pupa")) %>%
  #filter(if.sup == "Y") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg.tt, y=avg.logmass, color=trt.stage)) +
  geom_line(aes(lty = as.factor(sup))) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = instar), size = 3) +
  geom_point(data=NT_dev, aes(x=tt, y=logmass, color=trt.stage), alpha = 0.25) + 
  NT_aes() + facet_wrap(sup~pop, nrow=3) +
  labs(title = "NTs: average development from 4th - wander", color = "treatment", y = "log(mass (mg))", x = "days to instar",
       caption = "L+F, no pmd, enter at hatch") +
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.001, 1))
```

apparently i really liked this next plot
```{r var}
# this is it...
  #but need to filter out the lab bugs on TB/regular diet i think
NTsups_devsumm %>%
  filter(!(instar == "3rd" | instar == "pupa")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg.tt, y=avg.logmass, color=trt.stage)) +
  geom_line(aes(lty = as.factor(sup))) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = instar), size = 3) +
  geom_point(data=NT_dev, aes(x=tt, y=logmass, color=trt.stage), alpha = 0.25) + 
  NT_aes() + facet_wrap(pop~trt.stage, ncol=4) +
  labs(title = "NTs: average development from 4th - wander", color = "treatment", y = "log(mass (mg))", x = "days to instar",
       caption = "L+F, no pmd, enter at hatch") 
```

<!-- #### - pupa/endpoints only -->

calculate the stats
```{r pupa dev summ stats}
NT_devP <- NT_dev %>% filter(instar == "pupa")
NT_devsummP <- dev_L %>%
  filter.NTs2() %>%
  group_by(pop, sex, trt.stage, instar) %>%
  summarise(avg.mass = mean(na.omit(mass)),
            se.mass = sd(na.omit(mass))/sqrt(length(na.omit(mass))),
            avg.tt = mean(na.omit(tt)),
            se.tt = sd(na.omit(tt))/sqrt(length(na.omit(tt)))) %>% 
  filter(instar == "pupa")
```

graph it
```{r plot}
NT_devsummP %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg.tt, y=avg.mass, color=trt.stage)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_point(data=NT_devP, aes(x=tt, y=mass, color=trt.stage), alpha = 0.275) +
  y_err_mass(0.5) + x_err_tt(1) +
  NT_aes() + facet_wrap(sex~pop) +
  labs(title = "NTs: average development to pupa", color = "treatment", y = "mass (mg)", x = "days to instar")
```

# C1. (old) growth response as a function of treatment 

(keeping these bc theyre mostly fine but going to ignore the sex stuff a bit lol. we can get into it later. use C2 instead!

prep the df:
```{r filter NTs from larger dataset}
# subset data
long_NTs <- long_all %>% 
  #filter(is.NA(ignore.reason)) %>%
  filter.NTs2()
  # "slows" are messing things up
```

- mass.pup ~ meanT
```{r}
long_NTs %>%
  #filter(ignore.reason == "NA") %>%
  filter(instar == "pupa") %>%
  group_by(pop, sex, meanT) %>%

```

- mass.pup ~ flucT

```{r}

  #filter(!is.NA(ignore.reason)) %>%

  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(caption = "NT pupa")
  # smth is breaking bc this doesnt match the above LOL
```

- mass.pup ~ minT

this is the interesting one bc everyone has the same max T... altho it's lowkey the same as just plotting by `trt.stage` or something. it's more intuitive though, looking at graph-wise.
  - upon 2nd look this is wonky bc of the 26 group lol (theres' 26/26 and 40/26)
```{r}

  # this breaks so much LOL
```

(let's keep going w the other figs and ignore the potential sex differences for now bc it doesnt seem that major, based on the graphs where x = min T)

- plotting: by flucT

H: naively, if fluct T is all that matters, then "performance" should decrease as fluct gets larger.

```{r response var by flucT}

       color = "minimum temperature (°C)")
  # F/L: smaller if any fluct at all. in F, range is slightly bigger with bigger fluct (L is consistent range). L is generally larger than F at all sizes.

# avg tt pup
summary_NTs %>% ggplot(aes(y = avg.tt, x = flucT, color = as.factor(minT))) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +  y_err_tt(y_err= 0.5) +

  # F/L: v shape lol. they're kinda the same times which is interesting bc the masses r so differnt

           #risk.table = TRUE,
           legend.title = "fluctuation",
           xlab = "time in days")
  # sigh. lots to think about here. why is the 10.5 so good in the lab lmao (see below -- add in the mean)

ggsurvplot(fit = kmfit.byflucT, data = NTs_all,
           conf.int = TRUE,

           #risk.table = TRUE,
           legend.title = "treatment",
           xlab = "days since hatching")

```

overall i think this is all saying that pop/fluct/min/mean(?) all have an effect! (temp effects depend on pop..?) still not quite sure how to parse out "parameterising" temperature tho... (define it by fluct only? min T? meanT? etc?)

clearly it's like ~at some point~/in combo with other factors, a certain min is bad, mean is bad, fluct is bad, etc etc... maybe compare with the 2x2s (sweat smile)

 - plotting: lab bugs on TB/LD

just looking at pupation/time since the ctrl analyses suggest those are the things that are mostly diff btwn them.

# C3. revisualise with better lab controls (240124 followups)

purpose: based on the results by visualising effect of diet + per meeting followups, going to redo the plotting by NTs figs with the lab bugs on lab diet removed, so that diet isn't a variable in the analyses. (i.e. only differences between bugs should be temp treatment and pop. everyone's eating TB)

## - (**) data prep

```{r}

we'll just focus on NTs as the input variable for the redo graphs bc the other 2 are just different ways of grouping :p

# D1. modeling

based on the figs above,

- are there statistical diffs in tt pup for lab/field bugs? btwn trts?
- what are the main variables in determining tt pup?
- are there statistical diffs in surv for lab/field bugs? btwn trts?
- what are the main variables in determining surv? 
- influence of pop/minT on surv and tt pup?
  - probbb need to look at some cph models for the surv part

## - (**) data prep

for the analyses, drop the diurnal grp + lab bugs on lab diet

```{r}
# NTs_exptal <- NTs_all %>%
#   filter(treatment != 260) %>%
#   filter(!(pop == "lab" & diet == "LD"))

# # make minT a factor
# NTs_exptal2 <- NTs_exptal %>% as.factor() # i didnt figure this out lol

NTs_exptal <- NTs_all2 %>%
  filter(treatment != 260) %>%
  filter(!(pop == "lab" & diet == "LD")) %>%
  mutate(minT == as.factor(minT))
```


## - mass pup (skipping for now)

skipping mass for now bc that doesn't seem to be too affected generally by treatment (or at least, no big surprises)

## - ttpup

let's assume that generally, pop matters. which of our main temperature variables are important to/significant in predicting ttpup? (for now, mostly focusing on minT)

```{r}
# try minT as a numeric
mod.tt_minnum <- lm(tt.pupa ~ minT*pop, data = NTs_exptal)

# try minT as a factor
mod.tt_minfact <- lm(tt.pupa ~ as.factor(minT)*pop, data = NTs_exptal)

# running anovas
anova(mod.tt_minnum) # F test: signif (***) var btwn min T's. but not btwn pops/pop:minT?
#anova(mod.tt_minnum, test = "Chisq") # same as above lol
#summary(mod.tt_minnum)
summary(mod.tt_minfact) # 40-33 has the biggest effect. pop doesnt matter nor does the interaction. the R squared sucks
anova(mod.tt_minfact) # also (***) here. even more so than as numeric
```
`factor(minT)` mod:

- effect sizes are not stellar... you're faster(?) at 40-26 and even faster at 40-33. popn doesnt rlly matter and neither does the interaction
- just the minT predicts anything here

## - surv
- try `poly()`
- try minT as cofactor, numeric

```{r}
# glm with minT as numeric
mod.surv_minnum <- glm(status ~ minT*pop, data = NTs_exptal, family = "binomial")

# glm with minT as factor
mod.surv_minfact <- glm(status ~ as.factor(minT)*pop, data = NTs_exptal, family = "binomial")

# poly
mod.surv_minpoly <- glm(status ~ poly(NTs_exptal$minT, degree = 2), data = NTs_exptal, family = "binomial")

# effect sizes
summary(mod.surv_minfact)

# run anovas
anova(mod.surv_minnum, test = "Chisq") # pop ***, int .
anova(mod.surv_minfact, test = "Chisq") # everything is at least **
anova(mod.surv_minpoly, test = "Chisq") # idk how to interp but the overall poly is **
```

- `factor(minT)` mod:

  - being at 40-33 and from the lab matters i guess..
  - all the variables matter! isn't that surprising, considering the graphs.
  


## - cox ph

this feels somewhat worth pursuing -- are there differences in the dynamics of the different pop/temp trts. gut feeling is that they all seem to die relatively early (i.e. by 3rds) and then just trickle off afterward, and that there doesn't seem to be any major differences in the dynamics.

```{r an aside - if fact or num minT matters}
# how much do i need to change around when testing minT as a factor or as numeric?

# make a separate df where minT is a factor
test <- NTs_exptal
test$minT <- as.factor(test$minT)

# fit mods: 1 where everything is a factor; one where the data is numeric but the formula is a factor
testmod <- coxph(Surv(test$tt.exit, test$status) ~ minT*pop, data = test)
testmod2 <- coxph(Surv(NTs_exptal$tt.exit, NTs_exptal$status) ~ as.factor(minT)*pop, data = NTs_exptal)

# test
anova(testmod)
anova(testmod2)
```

outputs are the same, so looks like it doesn't matter too much how i handle the coding. (not sure why this doesn't seem to be the case for the lms tho). so, going forward, just going to run mods as numeric only (maaaaybe test on occasion with parsing out `minT` as a factor...)

```{r trying full int and add models}
# minT is numeric here. status: 1 = pmd

mod.cph_full <- coxph(Surv(NTs_exptal$tt.exit, NTs_exptal$status) ~ minT*pop, data = NTs_exptal)
anova(mod.cph_full, test = "Chisq") # pop: ***; minT:pop .
# anova(mod.cph_full) # same as above
summary(mod.cph_numfull) # poplab **; minT:poplab .

# (checking if order matters - i dont think it does, at least w this model)
mod.cph_full2 <- coxph(Surv(NTs_exptal$tt.exit, NTs_exptal$status) ~ pop*minT, data = NTs_exptal)
anova(mod.cph_full2, test = "Chisq") # pop ***, pop:minT .

# let's compare just an additive model?
mod.cph_add <- coxph(Surv(NTs_exptal$tt.exit, NTs_exptal$status) ~ minT + pop, data = NTs_exptal)
anova(mod.cph_add) # pop is ***

# compare the models
anova(mod.cph_add, mod.cph_full, test = "Chisq")
```
- from anova'ing the mods on their own, suggests that `population` might be the most important variable for determining survival here, and more minorly, their interaction with minimum temperature. this is somewhat surprising lol? (bc minT doesnt matter much at all...?)
  - should go and see how this compares to 2x2 data...... (reframe the 2x2 as minT?) → 240129: this was done, see `temps_analyses`
  
- comparison of the nested models suggests that... the interaction model isnt a wholllle lot better. (see: [this](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/cox-regression-models-for-survival-data-example-2.html) for more info about comparing?)

as a final comparison, let's also compare some even simpler models

```{r comparing w just minT or pop models}
mod.cph_pop <- coxph(Surv(NTs_exptal$tt.exit, NTs_exptal$status) ~ pop, data = NTs_exptal)
mod.cph_minT <- coxph(Surv(NTs_exptal$tt.exit, NTs_exptal$status) ~ minT, data = NTs_exptal)

# nested anovas
anova(mod.cph_pop, mod.cph_add, mod.cph_full, test = "Chisq") # mod 3 = .
anova(mod.cph_minT, mod.cph_add, mod.cph_full) # additive mod is better

# bc i dont really know what im doing
anova(mod.cph_pop, mod.cph_minT) # i think this just says that the models are different..
```

i still dont really get how to interpret these 👍 these results are hard to compare to the original 33±7 from the `temps` expt bc those bugs did toooo well lolol... (as in, the variables that matter here don't seem to matter in the temps expt)

(maybe need to not use minT? use something like meanTxflucT instead? but isn't that just changing up the grouping?)


# followups list

1. `C3. visualise with better lab controls (240124 followups)`
2. redo stats as factors (for minT) + new data per 240131 joel mtg: this is scattered thruout the analyses
3. todo: combine figs better (stack...)

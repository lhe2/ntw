# loading

## - packages

```{r loading message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate) # for datetime parsing
library(googlesheets4)

here::i_am("_tdt/scripts/import.Rmd")
library(here)
```

## - data

```{r import}
# import corrections:
  # prefix "2025" to dates
  # replace commas in notes
  # remove "dv." col bc not correctly calculated in gsheets...
df_raw <-
  read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rxZSI-8ubhMkeM2Sh1xNi5IKF0Vt_BDFItAg_Ak476M/edit?gid=1826657546#gid=1826657546",
             sheet = "tdt jun 2025", col_types = "c", na = c("#VALUE!")) %>%
  drop_na() %>% na_if("--") %>% na_if("") %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("date."), ~ str_c("2025/", .)),
         across(notes, gsub, pattern = ",", replacement = ";")) %>%
  rename(trt = treatment) %>%
  select(-starts_with("dv"))
```

# filtering and fixes
    
## - fix values

filter bugs accidentally culled before 3rd (dont fix `instar.exit` before this)

weights: 
  - drop masses of bugs at molts/return to 40C if they were already dead by the am (weight will not be accurate)

dates:
- parse culled vs died better (things with `.culled` should be empty in `.died` and vice versa)
- add return/recovery dates/times to 0hr recovery bugs

fix `instar.exit`

fix `fate`? (based on their expected deaths at 40C trts and survival at other trts)
  - 0 = died
  - 1 = surved to 4th (if expt, which none did) or to 3rd (slow ctrls were culled at 3rd)
  - 2 = culled (i.e. died before 1 or 2; usually disease, for the most part)

```{r fixes}
df_filtered <- df_raw %>%
  # filtering
  ## drop bugs accidentally culled before 3rd
  filter(!(!is.na(date.culled) & instar.exit < 3)) %>%
  
  # fixes
  ## fix masses of bugs if they died in the pm
  pivot_longer(c(ends_with(c("3rd", "4th", "return")), -starts_with(c("h", "time"))),
               names_to = c(".value", "event"), names_sep = "\\.") %>%
  mutate(mass = case_when(date == date.died & when.died == "am" ~ NA_real_,
                          TRUE ~ as.numeric(mass))) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = event, values_from = c("date", "mass"),

  ## add missing dates & times for 0h recovery bugs

                ~ case_when(trt.duration == 0 ~ date.enter, TRUE ~ .)),

                ~ case_when(trt.duration == 0 ~ time.enter, TRUE ~ .))) %>%

                                 !is.na(date.culled) | !is.na(date.pmc) ~ time.died),
         time.died = case_when(!is.na(time.culled) | !is.na(date.pmc) ~ NA_character_,

                               TRUE ~ time.died),
         when.died = case_when(!is.na(date.culled) ~ NA_character_,
                               TRUE ~ when.died)
         ) %>%
  
  ## fix instar.exit (dont know if need, but the gsheets is wrong for older bugs lol)
  mutate(instar.exit = case_when(!is.na(date.pupa) ~ "pupa",

                                 !is.na(date.5th) ~ "5",
                                 !is.na(date.4th) ~ "4",

                                 TRUE ~ "1")) %>%
  
  ## fix fates (based on bugs at 40 being expected to die)
  ## note: no expt bugs past 4th but not all ctrl bugs past 4th 
  mutate(fate = case_when(!is.na(date.pmc) ~ 2,
                          !is.na(date.died) ~ 0,
                          !is.na(date.culled) | !is.na(date.4th) ~ 1)
         )

```

## - stdise cols & times

standardise timepts (align everything to `hatch.time` to avoid negatives in `exit.from...` calcs later):
  - R2 d2 pm expt bugs recover time (returned late)
  - R3 d2 expt bugs recover time (data entry typo?)
  - R3 d2 26C bugs enter time (entered late)

stdise col formats and calcs
  - format date times: dh.hatch/enter/recover/return/died/culled
  - assign exit times
  - fix gaps in recover/return/etc
  
add jdate (tho mostly we are interested in the `dd.` cols for analyses)

```{r datetime calcs}
df_cleaned <- df_filtered %>%
  mutate(
    # align timepts

                            TRUE ~ time.return),
    ## R3 d2 expt bugs
    time.recover = case_when(date.hatch == "2025/7/24" & trt > 100 &
                               !is.na(date.return) ~ as.character(time.hatch),
